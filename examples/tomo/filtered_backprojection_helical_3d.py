"""Example using FBP in helical 3D geometry using `fbp_op`.

Note that the FBP is only approximate in this geometry, but still gives a
decent reconstruction that can be used as an initial guess in more complex
methods.

In helical geometries, the data are in general over-sampled which causes
streak artefacts and a wrong scaling. This can be reduced using a
Tam-Danielson window.
